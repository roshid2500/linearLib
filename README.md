# linearLib
This is a small library of matrix operations, linear independence/dependence, determinants, REF/RREF. 

This project is not yet complete as it is missing methods to find the eigenvales and eigenvectors.

Note that time complexities and space complexities of the methods thus far are not the most efficient.
